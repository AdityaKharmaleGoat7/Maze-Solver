# Rat in a Maze
This C++ program solves the "Rat in a Maze" problem using backtracking. Given a maze represented by a 2D array, where 1's represent valid paths and 0's represent obstacles, the program finds and prints all possible paths from the starting cell (0,0) to the destination cell (n-1,n-1) while avoiding obstacles.

# How to Use
Replace the arr array in the code with your maze. The maze should be represented as a 2D array, where 1's represent valid paths, and 0's represent obstacles.

Set the value of n to the size of the maze (number of rows/columns).

Run the program, and it will find and print all possible paths from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (n-1,n-1) of the maze.

# Note: If there is no valid path from the starting cell to the destination cell, the program will print "-1".
